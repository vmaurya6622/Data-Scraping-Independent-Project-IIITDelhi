If the curry paste isn&#39;t shining through as much as you&#39;d like, add a little glob of it and stir to dissolve. If you want more umami, add a little splash of soy sauce. If you want it more yellow, a pinch of turmeric powder can give it that brighter color. Add 1/2 cup of cauliflower rice to a bowl and squeeze 1/2 a lime on top.

Remove from heat; set aside. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir, cooking flour for about 1 minute.

Be sure to allow steam to escape as you process. This can also be done with an immersion blender. Pour the butternut squash bechamel sauce mixture back into the pot holding the remaining bechamel sauce; stir until combined. In a small skillet, cook the chorizo over medium heat, breaking it up into crumbles as it cooks. Set aside. To assemble the lasagna, ladle about 1/4 cup of butternut squash bechamel sauce into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Spread the sauce around evenly and top with 3 lasagna sheets, laying them side by side. Top with about 1/2 cup of the sauce, spreading it into one even layer. Then add a few spoonfuls of chorizo crumbles and a handful of Monterey Jack. Repeat the layering process a few more times until all but three lasagna sheets are used -- about 3 layers. Finally, top the lasagna with the last 3 lasagna sheets, a handful of Monterey Jack, and all of the Parmesan cheese. Cover the baking dish with Reynolds Wrap\\u00ae Aluminum Foil and bake for 15 minutes at 350 degrees F. Uncover and transfer the lasagna to the broiler, cooking about 5 minutes until the top is golden brown. Top with fresh cilantro. Slice and serve.
